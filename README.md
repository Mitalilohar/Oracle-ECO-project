Automated Engineering Change Order (ECO) Effectivity Date Updation
Overview
This project automates the process of updating Engineering Change Order (ECO) effectivity dates in the manufacturing module of Oracle Apps. Previously, this process was manual, time-consuming, and required coordination across multiple departments. By implementing automation, this solution significantly reduces manual effort, enhances workflow efficiency, and minimizes personnel dependency.

Key Features
Automated ECO Effectivity Date Update: Eliminates the need for manual data entry by fetching and updating dates dynamically.
Integration Across Multiple Departments: Streamlines coordination between engineering, production, and supply chain teams.
Time Efficiency: Saves 15 man-hours per month across various locations.
User-Friendly Execution: Allows users to update effectivity dates with just a few clicks.
Error Reduction: Minimizes human errors in data entry and scheduling.
Scalability: Can be extended to handle additional automation tasks within Oracle Apps.
Technology Stack
Oracle Apps R12
PL/SQL (Stored Procedures, Triggers, Packages)
Oracle Forms & Reports
Workflow Automation
Implementation Details
Data Extraction: Fetches pending ECO records requiring effectivity date updates.
Validation Process: Ensures compliance with predefined business rules before updating dates.
Automated Updates: Uses PL/SQL procedures to update effectivity dates dynamically.
User Interface: Oracle Forms provides an interactive UI for users to review and confirm updates.
Notifications & Logging: Tracks all updates for auditing and sends notifications to stakeholders.
Business Impact
✅ Time Savings: 15+ man-hours saved monthly.
✅ Improved Accuracy: Reduces manual errors and inconsistencies.
✅ Enhanced Productivity: Employees focus on higher-value tasks instead of repetitive data entry.
✅ Seamless Department Collaboration: Automated workflows reduce bottlenecks in the approval process.
