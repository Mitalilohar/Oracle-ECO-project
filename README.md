## **Automated Engineering Change Order (ECO) Effectivity Date Updation**  

### **Overview**  
This project automates the process of updating Engineering Change Order (ECO) effectivity dates in the manufacturing module of Oracle Apps. Previously, this process was manual, time-consuming, and required coordination across multiple departments. By implementing automation, this solution significantly reduces manual effort, enhances workflow efficiency, and minimizes personnel dependency.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Automated ECO Effectivity Date Update**: Eliminates the need for manual data entry by fetching and updating dates dynamically.  
- **Integration Across Multiple Departments**: Streamlines coordination between engineering, production, and supply chain teams.  
- **Time Efficiency**: Saves 15 man-hours per month across various locations.  
- **User-Friendly Execution**: Allows users to update effectivity dates with just a few clicks.  
- **Error Reduction**: Minimizes human errors in data entry and scheduling.  
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to handle additional automation tasks within Oracle Apps.  

### **Technology Stack**  
- **Oracle Apps R12**  
- **PL/SQL (Stored Procedures, Triggers, Packages)**  
- **Oracle Forms & Reports**  
- **Workflow Automation**  

### **Implementation Details**  
1. **Data Extraction**: Fetches pending ECO records requiring effectivity date updates.  
2. **Validation Process**: Ensures compliance with predefined business rules before updating dates.  
3. **Automated Updates**: Uses PL/SQL procedures to update effectivity dates dynamically.  
4. **User Interface**: Oracle Forms provides an interactive UI for users to review and confirm updates.  
5. **Notifications & Logging**: Tracks all updates for auditing and sends notifications to stakeholders.  

### **Business Impact**  
✅ **Time Savings**: 15+ man-hours saved monthly.  
✅ **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces manual errors and inconsistencies.  
✅ **Enhanced Productivity**: Employees focus on higher-value tasks instead of repetitive data entry.  
✅ **Seamless Department Collaboration**: Automated workflows reduce bottlenecks in the approval process.
